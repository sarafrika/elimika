# Instructor Domain Guide

## Overview

The **Instructor** domain represents educators who create, deliver, and manage educational content within the Elimika platform. Instructors can operate as independent content creators (global domain) or as faculty members affiliated with specific educational organizations.

## Instructor Domain Characteristics

### Core Capabilities
- **Content Creation**: Design courses, lessons, assessments, and rubrics
- **Student Management**: Monitor progress, provide feedback, grade assignments
- **Assessment Design**: Create quizzes, assignments, and evaluation criteria
- **Performance Analytics**: Track student engagement and learning outcomes
- **Certification Authority**: Award certificates upon course completion

## Global vs Organization Instructor Domains

### Global Instructor Domain

**Assignment**: Direct mapping in `user_domain_mapping` table
**Scope**: Platform-wide content creation and teaching authority
**Use Cases**:
- Independent course creators
- Freelance educators
- Subject matter experts
- Community contributors

Assignment is done by adding an entry to the `user_domain_mapping` table linking the user's UUID with the instructor domain's UUID.

**Capabilities**:
- Create public courses accessible to all students
- Publish to platform course catalog
- Earn revenue from course enrollments
- Build instructor reputation and ratings

### Organization Instructor Domain

**Assignment**: Contextual mapping in `user_organisation_domain_mapping` table
**Scope**: Institution-specific teaching and administrative responsibilities
**Additional Context**:
- Department/faculty assignment
- Academic rank and tenure status
- Semester/term associations
- Institution-specific policies and curricula

Assignment is done by adding a detailed entry to the `user_organisation_domain_mapping` table that links the user to the organization, the instructor domain, and optionally a specific branch, along with start dates and status.

    "organizationAffiliation": {
      "organisationUuid": "state-university",
      "organisationName": "State University",

### Multi-Branch Teaching Assignments

Instructors can teach across multiple departments within an organization. This is achieved by creating multiple `user_organisation_domain_mapping` entries for the same user and organization, each with a different `branch_uuid`.

    style I fill:#ff9800
    style J fill:#f44336
```

### Course Training Applications

Instructors must request access to each course they intend to deliver. Submit an application using `POST /api/v1/courses/{courseUuid}/training-applications` with your instructor UUID and supporting notes. Course creators review applications via `POST /api/v1/courses/{courseUuid}/training-applications/{applicationUuid}?action=approve|reject|revoke`. Only **approved** instructors can be assigned to class definitions tied to that course; attempts to schedule classes without an approved application are rejected automatically. If access is revoked, submit a new application to regain approval. You can check the status of your submissions via `GET /api/v1/courses/training-applications/search?applicantUuid={yourUuid}&applicantType=instructor`.

### Instructor Search and Analytics

The system provides advanced search capabilities for instructor management. A series of API endpoints allows searching for instructors based on various criteria:
-   **By Experience**: Find instructors with a minimum number of years of experience using the `/api/v1/instructors/search` endpoint.
-   **By Skills**: Search for instructors possessing specific skills at a certain proficiency level via the `/api/v1/instructors/skills/search` endpoint.
-   **By Education**: Filter instructors by their qualifications, such as having a PhD, using the `/api/v1/instructors/education/search` endpoint.
-   **By Current Position**: Find instructors who are currently active in a position via the `/api/v1/instructors/experience/search` endpoint.

This instructor domain implementation provides comprehensive support for both independent educators and institutional faculty, enabling effective content creation, student management, and professional development while maintaining appropriate quality standards and accountability measures.
