## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### 6.1 State Management
- Use a centralized state management solution (Redux/Zustand) for availability data.
- Implement optimistic updates for better user experience.
- Cache frequently accessed availability data.
- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets for multi-user scenarios.

### 6.2 Performance Considerations
- Lazy load availability data for date ranges outside the current view.
- Implement virtual scrolling for large calendar views.
- Use memo/memoization for expensive calendar calculations.
- Debounce drag-and-resize operations to reduce API calls.

### 6.3 Accessibility Requirements
- Ensure keyboard navigation for all calendar interactions.
- Provide screen reader support with proper ARIA labels.
- Include high contrast mode for availability visualization.
- Support voice input for mobile availability management.

### 6.4 Error Handling & Validation
- Implement client-side validation for time range conflicts.
- Provide clear error messages for scheduling conflicts.
- Handle network failures gracefully with retry mechanisms.
- Show loading states during API operations.

### 6.5 Data Validation Rules
```typescript
interface ValidationRules {
  timeRange: {
    startBeforeEnd: boolean; // start_time < end_time
    minimumDuration: number; // e.g., 30 minutes
    maximumDuration: number; // e.g., 12 hours
    intervalAlignment: number; // e.g., 15-minute intervals
  };
  dateRange: {
    effectiveStartBeforeEnd: boolean;
    maxFutureDate: number; // e.g., 2 years from now
    pastDateRestriction: boolean; // no past dates for new availability
  };
  patterns: {
    maxRecurrenceInterval: number; // e.g., max 52 weeks
    validDayOfWeek: [1, 7]; // Monday to Sunday
    validDayOfMonth: [1, 31];
    customPatternValidation: RegExp; // Cron expression validation
  };
}
```
