## Developer Guide: Implementing and Triggering Notifications

This section provides a technical guide for developers on how to work with the notification system.

### Core Concepts

The notification system is built on an event-driven architecture. To send a notification, you publish a `NotificationEvent`. The system listens for these events and handles the delivery through the appropriate channels (Email, In-App, SMS, Push) based on user preferences and notification type.

- **`NotificationEvent`**: The base interface for all notification events. It defines the common data required for any notification, such as recipient, priority, and template variables.
- **`NotificationService`**: The service responsible for sending notifications. It's an abstraction layer that decouples the event producers from the notification delivery logic.
- **Event Listeners**: The system uses event listeners to subscribe to `NotificationEvent`s and trigger the `NotificationService`.

### Available Notification Events

Here is a list of the currently available `NotificationEvent`s, their purpose, and the template variables they expect.

#### 1. `AssignmentDueReminderEvent`

### How to Trigger a Notification

As a front-end developer, you won't directly trigger notifications. Instead, your actions in the UI will trigger API calls to the back-end, which will then publish the appropriate `NotificationEvent`. For example, when a user fills out the "Invite User" form and clicks "Send Invitation," the front-end will make a `POST` request to the `/api/invitations` endpoint. The back-end will then handle the logic of creating and sending the invitation, and it will publish an `OrganizationInvitationEvent`.

Your primary responsibility is to ensure that the UI provides all the necessary data for the back-end to create these events. This guide should help you understand what data is needed for each notification type.

## Conclusion

This notification strategy transforms Elimika from a basic learning platform into an intelligent, engaging educational ecosystem. By focusing on user needs, respecting preferences, and delivering value through every communication, we create a notification system that genuinely enhances the learning experience rather than interrupting it.

The phased implementation approach ensures rapid delivery of high-impact features while building toward a sophisticated, AI-driven notification platform that adapts to user behavior and maximizes educational outcomes.

Success will be measured not just by engagement metrics, but by the platform's ability to support genuine learning achievement and user satisfaction through thoughtful, timely, and relevant communication.
